# Tests Directory

This directory contains automated tests for the FastAPI application with PostgreSQL integration. The tests ensure that the API endpoints work correctly and the database operations function as expected.

## Structure

```
tests/
├── __init__.py          <-- Makes the tests directory a Python package
├── README.md            <-- This file
└── test_api.py          <-- Tests for API endpoints and database operations
```

## Test Coverage

The `test_api.py` file includes tests for:

1. **Health Check Endpoint** (`/health`)
   - Verifies the endpoint returns 200 OK
   - Checks correct response format

2. **Root Endpoint** (`/`)
   - Verifies the endpoint returns 200 OK
   - Validates API status message

3. **Prediction Endpoint** (`/predict`)
   - Tests valid input data (California Housing features)
   - Validates response structure and data types
   - Verifies prediction is stored in the database
   - Tests error handling for:
     - Missing features
     - Invalid data types

4. **Get Predictions Endpoint** (`/predictions`)
   - Tests retrieving all prediction records
   - Validates data structure and content

5. **Get Prediction by ID Endpoint** (`/predictions/{prediction_id}`)
   - Tests retrieving a specific prediction by ID
   - Tests error handling for non-existent records

## Database Testing

The tests use SQLite in-memory database instead of PostgreSQL for test isolation and performance. This is achieved through dependency injection:

- A test database session is created for each test
- The session is injected into the application through dependency overrides
- Tables are created and dropped for each test to ensure isolation

## Running the Tests

From the project root directory, run:

```bash
docker-compose exec web pytest tests/
```

Expected output:
```

## Adding New Tests

When adding new tests:
1. Follow the existing pattern in `test_api.py`
2. Use the `TestClient` from FastAPI for API calls
3. Add clear assertions with meaningful error messages
4. Group related tests together
5. Add comments explaining test scenarios
6. Ensure database operations are properly tested
