       "households": 1193.0,
       "latitude": 37.88,
       "longitude": -122.23
     }'
   ```

3. Get all predictions:
```bash
   curl -X 'GET' 'http://localhost:8000/predictions'
```

## 4.3. Run the Tests

To run the automated tests:

```bash
docker-compose exec web pytest tests/
```

## 4.4. Use Jupyter for Development

Jupyter Notebook provides an interactive environment for model development, data exploration, and experimentation. You have two options to work with the Jupyter notebooks:

### 4.4.1. Access Options

1. **Through IDE (Recommended)**:

   ○ For VS Code:
   
      a. Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Shift+P` (Mac)
      b. Select "Dev Containers: Attach to Running Container..."
      c. Choose the container named `ml_api_with_postgresql_integration-jupyter-1`
      d. When prompted to open a folder, navigate to `/app`
      e. You can now work with notebooks directly in VS Code with all dependencies available
   
   ○ For Cursor:
   
      a. Click the Remote Explorer icon in the sidebar (or press `Ctrl+Shift+P` and search for "Attach to Running Container")
      b. Select the container named `ml_api_with_postgresql_integration-jupyter-1`
      c. When prompted to open a folder, navigate to `/app`
      d. You can now work with notebooks directly in Cursor with all dependencies available

2. **Through Web Browser**:
   
   ○ Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:8888
   ○ All required dependencies are already installed
   ○ Changes are automatically saved to your local files through Docker volumes

### 4.4.2. Selecting the Correct Kernel

When opening a notebook, make sure to select the correct kernel:

1. For a new notebook, click on "Select Kernel" in the top right
2. Choose "Python 3.10.16 (/usr/local/bin/python)" from the dropdown
3. This kernel has access to all dependencies installed in the container

### 4.4.3. Verifying the Container Environment

If you want to confirm you're working inside the container, run the following code in a notebook cell:

```python
# Check Python version
!python --version

# View container environment variables
import os
print(os.environ)

# Verify the operating system
!cat /etc/os-release
```

The output should show:
- Python 3.10.x
- Container-specific environment variables (including DATABASE_URL with 'db' hostname)
- Debian Linux as the operating system

### 4.4.4. Working with Notebooks

The provided notebooks are:

* `notebooks/01_data_exploration.ipynb`: Explores the California Housing dataset with visualizations and statistical analysis
* `notebooks/02_model_training.ipynb`: Develops and trains a regression model for housing price prediction, with model evaluation and serialization

### 4.4.5. Accessing the Database from Notebooks

To connect to the PostgreSQL database from your notebook:

```python
from sqlalchemy import create_engine
import os

# Get database URL from environment variable
db_url = os.environ.get("DATABASE_URL")

# Create engine
engine = create_engine(db_url)

# Example query
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_sql("SELECT * FROM predictions", engine)
df.head()
```

### 4.4.6. Troubleshooting

1. **Kernel not starting**: 
   - Verify the container is running with `docker ps`
   - Check container logs with `docker logs ml_api_with_postgresql_integration-jupyter-1`

2. **Missing dependencies**:
   - Dependencies are installed from requirements.txt. If you need additional packages:
     ```python
     !pip install package_name
     ```

3. **Database connection issues**:
   - Ensure the PostgreSQL container is running
   - Verify the DATABASE_URL environment variable with `os.environ.get("DATABASE_URL")`

Note: When working through the IDE, you're actually working inside the container where all dependencies are already installed. This ensures consistency between development and production environments.

# 5. Database Setup

The project uses PostgreSQL for storing prediction data. There are two approaches to database schema management:

## 5.1. Direct Table Creation

By default, this project uses direct table creation for simplicity:

1. Tables are automatically created at application startup using SQLAlchemy's `Base.metadata.create_all()` method in `app/main.py`.
2. The custom setup script `scripts/db_setup.py` runs during container initialization to ensure tables exist.

This approach was chosen for simplicity in a containerized environment where databases are often recreated from scratch.

## 5.2. Using Migrations

While the project is configured with Alembic for migrations, it currently doesn't use migration scripts. To switch to a migration-based approach:

1. Modify the SQLAlchemy models in `app/database/models.py`
2. Generate a migration script:
   ```bash
   alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Description"
   ```
3. Apply the migration:
   ```bash
   alembic upgrade head
   ```

# 6. Database Development Best Practices

When working with databases in a containerized environment, you have multiple approaches for database interaction. This section covers best practices for database development within Docker.

## 6.1. Database Interaction Approaches

### 6.1.1. Using Jupyter Notebooks

**Advantages:**
- **All-in-one environment**: Code execution, data visualization, and database interaction in one place
- **Documentation as you go**: Notebooks serve as self-documenting SQL exploratory sessions
- **Visualization integration**: Easily plot query results using pandas and matplotlib
- **Reproducibility**: Queries and their results are saved together in the notebook

**Best for:**
- Data exploration and analysis
- Creating data processing pipelines
- Prototyping database operations
- Learning and experimentation

### 6.1.2. Using VS Code/Cursor Database Extensions

**Advantages:**
- **Purpose-built tools**: Specialized features like schema visualization and query optimization
- **SQL-focused interface**: Better syntax highlighting and autocompletion
- **Database administration**: Easier to perform administrative tasks
- **Separate concerns**: Keeps database work distinct from application code

**Best for:**
- Schema design and management
- Complex query development and testing
- Database administration tasks
- Day-to-day database operations

## 6.2. Recommended Hybrid Approach

The most effective workflow combines both approaches:

1. **Use VS Code/Cursor Database Extensions for:**
   - Initial database setup and schema management
   - Complex SQL query development
   - Production database migrations
   - Database administration tasks

2. **Use Jupyter Notebooks for:**
   - Data exploration and analysis
   - Combining SQL queries with data processing
   - Documenting database workflows with explanations
   - Visualizing query results
   - Prototyping database interactions for your ML pipeline

## 6.3. Setting Up Database Tools

### 6.3.1. VS Code/Cursor Database Extension Setup

1. Install the `Database Client` or `SQLTools` + `SQLTools PostgreSQL/Cockroach Driver` extensions in VS Code/Cursor
  - `Database Client`: By cweijan
  - `SQLTools`: By Matheus Teixeira
  - `SQLTools PostgreSQL/Cockroach Driver`: By mtxr

2. Configure a new connection using these settings:
   - Host: `localhost`
   - Port: `5432` (the forwarded port)
   - Username: `user`
   - Password: `password`
   - Database: `ml_api_db`

3. `Database Client` vs. `SQLTools` + `SQLTools PostgreSQL/Cockroach Driver`
  - `Database Client`: if you prefer a simple GUI, easy browsing, and minimal setup.
  - `SQLTools` + `SQLTools PostgreSQL/Cockroach Driver`: if you want powerful code integration, deep customization, and adapter flexibility.

  **Option 1: Database Client**
  - Single installation - All-in-one solution with built-in PostgreSQL support
  - **Best for:** Visual learners, beginners, and those who prioritize ease of use
  - Modern interface with intuitive data exploration features
  - Simplified connection setup with fewer configuration steps
  - Better table visualization with interactive data grid view
  
  **Option 2: SQLTools + SQLTools PostgreSQL/Cockroach Driver**
  - Two-part installation - Core SQLTools extension plus PostgreSQL/Cockroach Driver
  - **Best for:** Those comfortable with SQL who need advanced features
  - More comprehensive SQL tooling with deeper code integration
  - Robust intellisense & linting capabilities
  - Highly extensible with plugins and fine-grained configuration
  
  Both options will connect to the project's PostgreSQL database using the same connection parameters. Consider your learning style and preferences when choosing - visual, GUI-focused learners may prefer Database Client, while code-centric, customization-focused learners might prefer SQLTools.

  **Feature Comparison:**

  | Aspect              | SQLTools                                                                                                                                                            | Database Client                                                                                                                                            |

### 6.3.2. Python Code Pattern for Notebooks

```python
from sqlalchemy import create_engine, text
import pandas as pd
import os

# Get database URL from environment variable
db_url = os.environ.get("DATABASE_URL")
engine = create_engine(db_url)

# For exploratory queries
def run_query(query):
    """Run a SQL query and return results as a DataFrame"""
    with engine.connect() as conn:
        result = conn.execute(text(query))
        return pd.DataFrame(result.fetchall(), columns=result.keys())

# Example usage
df = run_query("SELECT * FROM predictions LIMIT 10")
df.describe()  # Quick statistics
```

This hybrid approach gives you the best of both worlds - specialized database tools when needed and seamless integration with your data science workflow in notebooks.

# 7. Working with PostgreSQL Database

Unlike SQLite which uses a single file, PostgreSQL is a client-server database system that manages data internally. This section explains how data is stored and accessed in this project.

## 7.1. Database Storage in PostgreSQL

When you collect and store data using this API:

1. **Data Storage**: PostgreSQL stores all data in its internal directory structure, which is mounted as a Docker volume (`postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data/`).

2. **No Single Database File**: You won't see a database file in your project directory. Instead, PostgreSQL manages its data files internally.

3. **Persistence**: The Docker volume ensures data persists even if containers are stopped or rebuilt.

## 7.2. Accessing PostgreSQL Data

There are multiple ways to access the stored data:

1. **Through API Endpoints**: Use the provided API endpoints (`/predictions`) to retrieve data.

2. **Direct Database Access**: Connect to the PostgreSQL instance:
   ```
   Host: localhost
   Port: 5432
   Username: user
   Password: password
   Database: ml_api_db
   ```

3. **From Jupyter Notebooks**: Use the SQLAlchemy code pattern provided in section 6.3.2.

4. **Using Database GUIs**: Connect with tools like pgAdmin, DBeaver, or database extensions in VS Code/Cursor.

## 7.3. Database Inspection Commands

When the containers are running, you can inspect the database using:

```bash
# Connect to PostgreSQL container's shell
docker exec -it ml_api_with_postgresql_integration-db-1 bash

# Connect to PostgreSQL with psql client
psql -U user -d ml_api_db

# Useful psql commands:
# \dt - list tables
# \d+ predictions - show table structure
# SELECT * FROM predictions LIMIT 5; - view data
# \q - quit psql
```

## 7.4. Backing Up and Restoring Data

To back up and restore your PostgreSQL data:

```bash
# Backup: from host machine
docker exec -t ml_api_with_postgresql_integration-db-1 pg_dump -U user ml_api_db > backup.sql

# Restore: to host machine
cat backup.sql | docker exec -i ml_api_with_postgresql_integration-db-1 psql -U user -d ml_api_db
```

The client-server architecture of PostgreSQL provides benefits including better performance, concurrent access, and more robust data management compared to file-based databases.

# 8. Summary

This project demonstrates how to build a machine learning API with PostgreSQL integration using FastAPI and Docker. It provides a complete framework for:

1. Training and serving machine learning models
2. Storing predictions in a PostgreSQL database
3. Retrieving prediction history
4. Running everything in Docker containers for reproducibility and scalability

The project is designed to be easily adaptable for different machine learning tasks and datasets while maintaining a strong focus on engineering best practices.
